/* Breadth First Search/Traversal */
// + Shortest Path Closer Nodes
// - More Memory Used

/* Depth    First Search/Traversal */
// + Less Memory Used/Check if Path Exist from Source Node to a Target Node
// - Can Get Slow

/* Exercise/Example Questions */

//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
/* BFS */

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
/* BFS (DFS will take a longer time) */

//If the tree is very wide:
/* DFS (BFS will need too much memory) */

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
/* DFS */

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
/* DFS */

//Finding the shortest path:
/* BFS */
